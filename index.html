        </p>

        <ul> •	The teddy was named after President Theodore Roosevelt, after he refused to shoot a bear during a 1902 hunting trip. </ul>
        <ul> •	Inspired by a cartoon featuring the event, shopkeeper Morris Michtom and his wife Rose made a stuffed bear with a sign ‘Teddy’s bear’ and left it in their shop window. It gained so much attention that they started a successful toy making company.</ul>
        <ul> •	Meanwhile, in Germany in the same year, the Steiff family developed a silk-like fabric bear, based on zoo animals. They caused a sensation at a toy fair and were snapped up by an American buyer.</ul>
        <ul> • They aren’t just for children – 40% of teddy sales are for adults, and a quarter of us still has our childhood companion.</ul>
